Nielsen's 10 Heuristics and How They Apply to HONESTCAPES

1. Visibility of System Status
	Posts on the class pages update automatically when new posts are made, as well as when a user themselves posts, the user is informed whether their post was successful or not. Strings typed within the search bar automatically update the table so the list of relevant courses are the only ones viewed. 
2. Match Between System and Real World
	Posts appear chronologically and are ordered as such, and language is kept simple, with the only exception being course descriptions copied directly off of the UCSD Schedule of Classes descriptions. 
3. User Control and Freedom
	Navigation bar contains buttons to allow users to redirect to all other pages of the website. Additionally, when making a post, the user is promted to confirm submission. 
4. Consistency and Standards
	Logout buttom is positioned at a familiar place in the top rght-hand corner of the page, and other navigation is also familiarly in place at the top.
	Options to make posts are in clear view to the user, and their posts appear at the top of the stack as the posts will update. 
5. Error Prevention
	Before a star rating or a comment post is submitted, the user will be asked to confirm their submission. 
6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
	The course and professor that the user is browsing is clearly displayed and salient at the top of the page. Autofocus on the "post" box once the user loads the course page.
7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
	 Users are able to type strings within the search bar on the courses page to automatically update the table so the list of relevant courses are the only ones viewed. 
8. Aesthetic and Minimalistic Design
	There aren't any dialogues or animations that are unnecessary and detract from the aesthetics of the design. Website is clean and visually pleasing.
9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
	If the search does not match an existing registered course, the user is notified. 
10. Help and Documentation
	Documentation is available in a familiar location on the navigation bar to help guide the user if necessary.
